# TryHackMe – Linux Fundamentals Part 2

This folder contains my personal documentation and learning summary from the **Linux Fundamentals Part 2** room on TryHackMe.

This part builds on the fundamentals from Part 1 and focuses on deeper interaction with the Linux filesystem, permissions, user management, system directories, and secure remote access.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How Linux handles hidden files and directories
- Using built-in Linux documentation (`man`, `--help`)
- Creating, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories
- Understanding Linux file permissions (read, write, execute)
- Identifying file types independently of file extensions
- Switching between users and understanding login environments
- Important Linux system directories and their purposes
- Secure remote access to Linux machines using SSH

## 🛠️ Commands & Concepts Covered

- `ls`, `ls -a`, `ls -l`, `ls -lh` – list directory contents, hidden files, permissions, and human-readable sizes  
- `man`, `--help` – command documentation  
- `touch` – create files  
- `mkdir` – create directories  
- `cp`, `cp -R` – copy files and directories  
- `mv` – move or rename files  
- `rm`, `rm -R` – delete files and directories  
- `file` – identify file types  
- File permissions (`r`, `w`, `x`) – access control  
- `su`, `su -l` – switch users and load login environments  
- `/etc` – system configuration directory  
- `/root` – root user home directory  
- `/var` – variable data and system logs  
- `/tmp` – temporary files directory  
- `ssh` – secure remote access

## 🎯 Purpose

This documentation demonstrates hands-on Linux experience and a solid understanding of core Linux concepts.

These skills are fundamental for:
- Cybersecurity (SOC / Blue Team / Pentesting)
- Linux system administration
- Log analysis
- Remote server management
- Working with real-world Linux-based environments
