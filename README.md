# 🛡️ Cyber Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cyber Portfolio** - a collection of projects, labs, and hands-on exercises that I complete as I learn and practice cyber.

This repository will gradually document my progress in areas such as:
- Blue team fundamentals (log analysis, investigations)
- Offensive security basics (recon, enumeration)
- Web security concepts
- SOC investigation rooms (SIEM, log analysis)
- Tools and techniques used in real-world cybersecurity

Each folder contains:
- `summary.md` — written explanation of what I learned  
- `readme.md` — short description of the lab  
- `screenshots/` — images demonstrating tools & methodology (no flags or answers)

I will update this repository as I complete additional rooms, labs, and mini-projects.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Portfolio
The goal of this repository is to:
