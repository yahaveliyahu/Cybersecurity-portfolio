# Linux – Hands-On Practice & Fundamentals

This directory contains my hands-on learning, practice, and documentation
related to **Linux fundamentals**, based mainly on the **TryHackMe Linux Fundamentals** series.

The focus is on understanding how Linux systems work in practice,
using the terminal, managing processes and services, working with logs,
and performing common system administration tasks.
