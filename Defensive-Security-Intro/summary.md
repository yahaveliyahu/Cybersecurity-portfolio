# Defensive Security Intro – Summary

## Overview
In this room, I explored the fundamentals of **Defensive Security**, also known as **Blue Teaming**.  
The focus was on how organisations protect their networks, systems, and data from cyber threats, and how defensive teams operate in real-world environments.

Defensive security is not based on a single tool or action, but on multiple layers of protection, detection, and response working together.

## Key Areas of Defensive Security

### 1. Monitoring and Detection
Defensive teams continuously monitor network and system activity to identify suspicious or abnormal behaviour.

Examples include:
- Detecting login attempts from unusual locations
- Identifying abnormal traffic patterns
- Monitoring authentication failures

This phase is critical for early detection of attacks.

---

### 2. Incident Response
When suspicious activity is confirmed, the **Incident Response (IR)** process begins.

This includes:
- Investigating the incident
- Containing and removing the threat
- Restoring systems to normal operation
- Learning from the incident to prevent future attacks

---

### 3. Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence involves collecting and analysing information about attackers, their tools, techniques, and targets.

By understanding attacker behaviour, organisations can:
- Anticipate future attacks
- Strengthen weak points
- Improve detection rules and security controls

---

### 4. Vulnerability Management
Vulnerability management focuses on identifying and fixing weaknesses in systems and software before attackers can exploit them.

This can include:
- Manual vulnerability assessments
- Automated vulnerability scanning tools
- Regular patching and updates

---

### 5. Investigation and Analysis
Defensive teams analyse security events to separate normal activity from malicious behaviour.

This often involves:
- Log analysis
- Correlating multiple data sources
- Investigating anomalies in depth

## Defensive Security Roles

I was introduced to common roles within a defensive security team:

- **SOC Analyst** – Monitors alerts and investigates suspicious activity  
- **Incident Responder** – Handles active security incidents and containment  
- **Security Engineer** – Builds and maintains security tools and systems  
- **Digital Forensics Analyst** – Collects and analyses evidence after incidents  

Each role contributes to protecting the organisation.

## Defence in Depth
Organisations use a layered security approach known as **Defence in Depth**.

Examples of defensive measures:
- Employee security awareness training
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Firewalls
- Security policies and access controls

Even if one layer fails, others remain in place to reduce impact.

---

## Security Operations Centre (SOC)
The **SOC** is the central hub of defensive security operations.

Typical SOC activities include:
- Reviewing alerts from security tools
- Investigating anomalies
- Responding to incidents
- Monitoring systems 24/7

SOC teams act as the first line of defence.

---

## SIEM Systems
**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** systems aggregate logs and events from across the organisation into a single platform.

SIEMs allow teams to:
- Correlate events
- Detect threats faster
- Investigate incidents efficiently

They act as the "radar" of defensive security.

---

## Security Actions in Practice
I also explored common defensive actions such as:
- Blocking malicious IP addresses
- Implementing rate limiting
- Updating Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules

These actions help mitigate attacks in real time and prevent recurrence.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Defensive security focuses on protection, detection, and response
- Blue Team operations rely on people, processes, and technology
- Monitoring and visibility are critical
- Layered security significantly reduces risk
- Real-world incidents show the cost of poor security practices
