# TryHackMe – Offensive Security Intro

This folder contains my personal summary and documentation of the **Offensive Security Intro** room from TryHackMe.

The exercise focuses on:
- Understanding basic offensive security concepts  
- Performing directory enumeration using `dirb`  
- Interpreting scan results to identify hidden or sensitive website pages  
- Learning how enumeration fits into the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing  

## 📂 Contents
- **summary.md** – A detailed explanation of what I learned, the steps I performed, key takeaways, and security best practices.
- **screenshots/** – Supporting images showing the `dirb` command, partial scan output (without flags/answers), and a discovered page.

This documentation is intended to demonstrate my practical learning and hands-on experience in offensive security techniques.
