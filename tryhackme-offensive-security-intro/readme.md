# TryHackMe – Offensive Security Intro

This folder contains my personal summary and documentation of the
**Offensive Security Intro** room from TryHackMe.

The room provides hands-on practice with fundamental offensive security concepts,
focusing on how attackers enumerate web applications during the reconnaissance phase.

The main topics covered include:
- Understanding core offensive security and reconnaissance concepts
- Performing directory enumeration using `dirb`
- Interpreting scan results to identify hidden or sensitive web pages
- Understanding how enumeration contributes to real-world penetration testing workflows

## 📂 Contents
- **summary.md** – A detailed explanation of the actions performed, key learnings,
  and security best practices derived from the exercise.
- **screenshots/** – Supporting images demonstrating the use of the `dirb` tool,
  partial scan output (without flags or answers), and an exposed page discovered
  during enumeration.

This documentation is intended to demonstrate my practical learning and hands-on experience with web enumeration techniques in an ethical learning environment.
